The Food Restaurant Website is a web-based application designed to represent a restaurant’s online presence by showcasing its brand, menu, services, and contact information in a visually appealing and interactive way. 
The website aims to provide a seamless and engaging experience for users, making it easy for them to explore the restaurant’s offerings and get in touch for reservations or inquiries.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project emphasizes the core principles of front-end web development. The design focuses on responsive layouts to ensure that the website functions smoothly across all device types, 
including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
